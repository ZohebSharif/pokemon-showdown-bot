# Pokémon Showdown Optimal Move Bot

This project is a bot designed to provide the most optimal move during a battle in **Pokémon Showdown**. The bot analyzes the current game state and suggests the best possible action based on the available moves and Pokémon.

## Project Overview

This project is in the early stages of development. The bot is planned to become a Chrome extension that integrates with Pokémon Showdown and suggests optimal moves during gameplay.

### Features
- **Pokéball Themed UI**: The frontend features a visually engaging design styled like a Pokéball.
- **Move Suggestions**: The bot will suggest the best move based on the current game state (coming soon).

## Installation Instructions

To use this bot, follow the steps below to install it as a Chrome extension:

1. Clone this repository or download the files directly.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pokemon-showdown-bot.git
    ```
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable **Developer mode** in the top-right corner.
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the folder where you cloned/downloaded the project.
5. The extension will now be installed in Chrome.

## Usage

1. Once installed, click the Pokéball icon in your Chrome toolbar to open the bot's interface.
2. When you're in a Pokémon Showdown battle, click the **Pokéball** button to get a move suggestion.
3. The bot will provide the most optimal move based on the current game state (still under development).

## How It Works

- **Frontend**: The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a Pokéball-themed button that interacts with Pokémon Showdown.
- **Backend (Coming Soon)**: In future versions, the backend will analyze game states using an AI model and fetch battle data from Pokémon Showdown.

## Future Improvements

- **AI Integration**: Build an AI model to predict the best move based on the game state.
- **Battle History**: Save and analyze past battles to improve the bot's performance.
- **Additional Customization**: Add features like team analysis, move predictions, and compatibility with other Pokémon Showdown formats.
